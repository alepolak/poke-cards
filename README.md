# First ReactJs project - Pokemon Cards

I'm using this project to learn ReactJs with hooks.

## Functionality

* The PokemonService receives the amount of cards to show, and return all the information from the Pokemons and Pokemon Cards starting from the first pokemon.
* The information is fetched from PokemonTGC API and PokeApi API, and is used to create the PokemonData.
* The PokemonData is used to not only complete the card info, but also to generate the card style (pokemon image, background, font colors, etc).

## Future improvements

* A more personalized way to see the Pokemons Cards (search by pokemon name, number, type, etc).
* Start drawing a card when all the information needed for that specific card it's fetched.
